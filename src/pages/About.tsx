              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple calculation using a person's height and weight. The formula is BMI = kg/m<sup>2</sup> where kg is a person's weight in kilograms and m<sup>2</sup> is their height in meters squared.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                BMI is an inexpensive and easy screening method for weight categoryâ€”underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity. While BMI does not measure body fat directly, it is moderately correlated with more direct measures of body fat and is strongly correlated with various metabolic and disease outcomes.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                We take a holistic view of nutrition, recognizing that dietary needs vary based on individual factors like BMI, activity level, health conditions, and personal preferences. Our recommendations are based on current nutritional science and focus on sustainable eating patterns rather than restrictive diets.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                Our recipe collections are carefully curated to provide options that are not only nutritionally appropriate for different BMI categories but also delicious and practical to prepare.

                While NutriGuide provides general dietary recommendations based on BMI categories, these suggestions are not intended to replace professional medical advice. Individual nutritional needs can vary significantly based on factors not captured by BMI alone.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                We encourage users to consult with healthcare providers, especially registered dietitians or nutritionists, for personalized nutrition guidance, particularly for those with existing health conditions or special dietary requirements.
